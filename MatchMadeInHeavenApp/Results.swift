Your deep need is to possess a lover wholly, to make your partner surrender to you body and soul. This, predictably, leads to stormy scenes; it is not easy for anyone to deal with such possessiveness. You are very sensitive to any rebuff; you can bristle like a porcupine. If someone does not respond to your love, you may even become vindictive. (If you have the Sun in Libra or Sagittarius, however, the jealous drive is lightened.)

However, you cannot sustain the emotion, and therefore never completely sacrifice your freedom to another person. What you want is the unobtainable--perfect love-and even if you could find it you would shrink from being possessed by it. With such contradictory attitudes, it's no wonder you leave your lovers terminally puzzled. Basically, Venus-Sagittarians are high-spirited, outgoing, and highly imaginative. You tend to attract powerful and influential friends and find it much easier to deal with friends than with lovers. For one thing, friendship is less demanding.

However, it is far from telling the whole story. When in love, you are loyal, faithful, and dependable. If you don't marry rich, you work to give a mate security, and that includes material comforts. You may not be demonstrative and flowery, but what you say you mean. There is a dichotomy between your emotional life and your sexuality: You have earthy passions but keep them separate from your mental attitude. You can be sexually involved and detached at the same time. Venus in this position indicates a personality that is jealous, possessive, and fearful of rejection.

You cannot tolerate jealousy and will walk away from emotional scenes. You believe in fairness and openness. As a Venus-Aquarian, you are most likely to have platonic friendships because sexual involvements are more emotionally binding than you like. You are immensely popular, and can attract a great many lovers, often, however, you choose to direct your personal magnetism toward larger concerns and more enduring verities than mere romance, Aquarius is the sign of hopes and wishes, and Venus in this sign usually grants you what you dream of (though not until midlife or later)."

You have an unfortunate penchant for choosing the wrong kind of lover, the kind who will take emotionally but not give back. Venus-Pisceans often have a secret love affair that causes them grief. You are completely intuitive about love, never logical. No other position of Venus can be as self-sacrificing or places more importance on the happiness of loved ones. You have true empathy for the problems of another person. Venus also indicates an imaginative and creative artistic flair, which helps you to put your feelings into writing, acting, or music.

In matters of sex, you experience desire in the mind before it becomes a reality. You enjoy the adventure leading up to lovemaking and have passions that are easily aroused. However, as soon as an affair loses zest and becomes ordinary you look for the escape hatch. You tend to have a number of affairs and marriages.

You are sensuous but refined, and your lovemaking is a highly intuitive art. Your passion, however, is dependent on what is forthcoming from a lover. If a lover is insensitive or unresponsive, he or she may find that your get-up-and-go just got up and went. Yet, as a native of this Mars placement, you will cling to a relationship that does not make you happy. You react only in outbursts of temper and nervous irritability.

Hot-blooded and impulsive, you are successful in sex relationships because of your dynamism. You must dominate in affairs and demand a great deal of attention, but you are also warm, expressive, ardent, and affectionate. You prefer to make love in luxurious, rich surroundings. You are creative at work, but at times can be overbearing, authoritative, and a bit condescending. Mars-Leos see events in terms of themselves it would never occur to you to be an anonymous observer.

In your work you are shrewd, calculating, and quietly determined. You suspect people who only want to deal with big problems because somehow such people never seem to reach any useful conclusions. Mars-in-Virgo may appear sexually cool, but in truth you glamorize sex. You want it to be both physically rapturous and mentally exciting. Your passions are strong but kept under tight rein.
